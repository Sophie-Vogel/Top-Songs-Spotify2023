# Spotify Song Popularity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the factors that contribute to a song's popularity on Spotify, specifically analyzing the relationship between danceability, valence, and stream counts. Using Tableau Data Visualizer, I examined how these attributes influence the success of songs over a ten-year period.

## Data Sources
- The dataset includes the **top 25 most popular songs from 2013 to 2023** on Spotify.
- **Data Source**: Kaggle Spotify dataset ([Spotify Dataset - 2023](#))
- Key features analyzed: 
  - **Danceability**: Measured using song features such as beat strength, tempo stability, and overall tempo. This value determines how easily a person could dance to a song throughout its entirety.
  - **Valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 (or 0-100%) describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Songs with high valence sound more positive (e.g., happy, cheerful, euphoric), while songs with low valence sound more negative (e.g., sad, depressed, angry).
  - **Stream Count**: The number of times a song has been played on Spotify.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Obtained from publicly available Kaggle Spotify datasets.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and structured for visualization in Tableau.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards to identify trends and correlations.
- **Analysis**: Evaluated statistical relationships between danceability, valence, and popularity metrics.

## Key Findings
- **Happier songs tend to be more danceable.**
- **Danceability is a factor in a song’s popularity** (measured by stream count) but is less impactful than valence.
- **Both valence and danceability are key components** of song popularity on Spotify from 2013-2023.
- **Blinding Lights by The Weeknd** was listened to over **4 billion times** on Spotify, demonstrating the extreme reach of highly popular songs.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and analysis
- **Kaggle Spotify Dataset**: Source of song attributes and popularity metrics ([Spotify Dataset - 2023](#))
- **Python (Optional)**: For data preprocessing and cleaning (if applicable)

## Conclusion
Understanding the characteristics of popular songs provides insights into music industry trends and consumer behavior. This analysis highlights how danceability and valence contribute to a song’s success on streaming platforms like Spotify.

## Future Work
- Expanding the dataset to include more songs for deeper analysis.
- Incorporating other audio features like tempo, energy, and loudness.
- Comparing trends across different streaming platforms.
